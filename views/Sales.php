<strong>Introductory Statement </strong> 
<p>We here at Original media for Gamers are always interested in exploring new 
  sponsorship opportunities. We take great pride in supporting our sponsors by 
  offering highly cost effective and targeted marketing plans that allow incoming 
  sponsors the opportunity to name their own price. Our live streams and podcasted 
  radio shows target a 15 - 40 year old male demographic that is interested in 
  video gaming as well as technology. So if you have a business, organization, 
  or even a guild you're looking to promote, contact us at sales@omfg.fm today.</p>
<p><strong>Details</strong></p>
<p>We produce and customize our ads and keep them short and sweet so they are 
  not only entertaining but brief enough that it becomes more of a hassle to skip 
  over them then to just let them play. Ad breaks are not removed from the archived 
  podcasts of our live streamed show. Unlike banner ads, this form of advertising 
  actually engages your target market, our listeners, in a way they recognize 
  and respect. This is a highly effective channel through which traffic from the 
  market your products and services appeal to can be directed right to your site.</p>
<p>We also offer individual show sponsorship with hosts giving special mention 
  regarding the product and a &#8220;brought to you by&#8221; disclaimer on every 
  show. These shows are also put into our 24/7 live stream and podcast archives 
  with the ads embedded. Exclusive sponsorship of specific shows guarantees that 
  no ads for other products will air during that show.</p>
<p>On top of our radio ads we also offer banner ad space as well. This banner 
  can be designed by either the client or OMFG in a rotating advertisers&#8217; 
  banner slot. Alternatively, the banner can be placed in a static banner slot 
  dedicated to one advertiser. </p>
<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>
<p><em>What is OMFG?</em></p>
<p>OMFG is an acronym which stands for Original Media for Gamers. We are a live 
  internet radio station with five years of experience in live broadcasting and 
  we are looking to expand. We offer everything to the gamer population from gaming 
  news to live eSports broadcasting and commentary with live streaming video.</p>
<p><em>Why should I advertise with OMFG?</em></p>
<p>Our radio shows and live eSports broadcasts target a 15 to 40 year old male 
  demographic that is interested in video gaming as well as technology. We offer 
  a unique avenue of advertising to an elusive demographic and we have five years 
  of experience appealing to and growing our audience. Our listener base is fully 
  supportive of our sponsors just as our sponsors are supportive of our station.</p>
<p><em>What sort of marketing plans do you offer?</em></p>
<p>We strive to be pioneers in both the media world as well as our manner of advertising. 
  In celebration of this fact we at OMFG have a unique name your own price system 
  for incoming advertisers. You tell our sales team exactly how much you have 
  to spend in your advertising budget, and we'll tell you exactly how many live 
  plays your radio ads will get and/or how many banner rotations you'll receive.</p>
<p><em>Do I have to commit?</em></p>
<p>However long our advertisers feel they wish to commit to their support of the 
  station is completely and entirely up to them upfront. If you, as a potential 
  advertiser, are curious of how effective our advertising is but don't wish to 
  commit to a long-term contract, you can tell us how long you want to sign on, 
  in monthly increments, to try us out. After that point, if you are satisfied 
  with the incoming traffic and exposure, you are free to resign on for a longer 
  period of time.</p><br>
